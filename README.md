# ParkinsonPredictor_EnsembleModel
Project Description
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on the early detection of Parkinson's disease through the analysis of voice signal features and clinical data. Leveraging advanced classification algorithms, this project aims to provide a reliable tool for healthcare professionals to assist in diagnosing Parkinson's disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Implements techniques to clean and prepare the dataset, ensuring high-quality input for model training.
Multiple Classification Algorithms: Utilizes a variety of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to identify the most effective approach for diagnosis.
Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, providing insights into the reliability of predictions.
User -Friendly Interfaces:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Developed a GUI that allows users to easily input patient data and visualize predictions, making the tool accessible for non-technical users.
Command Line Interface (CLI): Implemented a CLI for advanced users who prefer a text-based interaction, allowing for quick testing and integration into other workflows.
Performance Improvements: Enhanced model performance through feature selection and hyperparameter tuning, resulting in improved accuracy and reduced false positive rates compared to initial implementations.
Motivation
Early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project is inspired by the growing body of research highlighting the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics, particularly in neurodegenerative disorders.

Research Alignment
This project aligns with the findings of the research paper "Machine Learning for the Diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease: A Review of Literature" by Mei et al. (2021), which emphasizes the importance of feature selection and the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in diagnosing Parkinson's disease.
